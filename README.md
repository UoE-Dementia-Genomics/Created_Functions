# Group Created Functions
This respository contains functions created by the group for specific tasks

## Forest Plots
The function forestES creates a forest plot for effect sizes and standard errors. The function also allows colouring and segmenting of data as required. ExampleforestES gives example code for making the plot.

## Mini Manhattan Plots
The function miniman created a regional Manhattan plot for genomic data, with genomic position on the x-axis, -log10(p) of the y-axis and a genomic track underneath. Points on the Manhattan can also be coloured for direction of effect. Exampleminman provides example code for making the plot.
