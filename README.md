## Mini Manhattan Plots
The function miniman created a regional Manhattan plot for genomic data, with the genomic position on the x-axis, -log10(p) of the y-axis, and a genomic track underneath. Points on the Manhattan can also be coloured for the direction of effect. Exampleminman provides example code for making the plot.

The function genetracks will just make the gene tracks of a specified location without a Manhattan plot.
